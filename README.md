# ReactJS and Tailwind CSS Project

This project, developed by Vicky Maulana, leverages the power of ReactJS and Tailwind CSS to create a dynamic and visually appealing web application. The combination of these technologies ensures a modern and efficient development process.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will launch the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

    The page will automatically reload whenever you make changes, and lint errors will be displayed in the console if any.

## Testing

To execute the test suite, run:

```bash
npm test
```

This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode, providing real-time feedback on your tests.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command optimizes the application for production, resulting in minified code and hashed filenames. The production-ready build is located in the `build` folder.
